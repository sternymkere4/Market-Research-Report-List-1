<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental adhesives and sealants are crucial for bonding procedures in dentistry, with three main types: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesives bond by applying an acidic primer, eliminating the need for a separate etching step, which simplifies the process. Selective-etching combines both methods, etching enamel while preserving dentin, enhancing bond strength. Total-etching adhesives involve etching both enamel and dentin before applying the adhesive, providing a strong bond, but requiring more steps. Each type is tailored for specific dental applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Dental Adhesives and Sealants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Restoration Bonding</li><li>Indirect Restoration Bonding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental adhesives and sealants play a crucial role in restorative dentistry, aiding both direct and indirect restoration bonding. Direct restoration bonding involves the immediate application of adhesives to dental materials, allowing seamless attachment to the tooth structure during procedures like fillings. In contrast, indirect restoration bonding refers to using adhesives for pre-fabricated restorations, such as crowns or inlays, which are fabricated outside the mouth and require bonding to the tooth surface. Both applications enhance durability and longevity of dental restorations.</p></p>
